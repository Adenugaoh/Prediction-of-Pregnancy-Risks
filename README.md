# Prediction-of-Pregnancy-Risks 
Introduction
Pregnancy complications poses significant challenges in the area of maternal health. These complications result in long-term physical incapacitation, mental health challenges, and adverse neonatal outcomes, ultimately affecting the overall well-being of both mothers and their children.

Aims of this project
The primary aim of this study is to develop and implement machine learning models for predicting maternal health risks. It is also, to stratify pregnancy risk levels into low, medium, and high categories, providing a clear framework for healthcare professionals.

Machine-Learning Models
Advanced Machine-Learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest are implemented, coupled with GridsearchCV tool which selects best parameter of the options presented by these robust algorithms

Summary of Findings
Following a detailed analysis the outcomes of the models, the Random Forest model has performed optimally with F1 score for the high risk as 0.91, AUC-ROC as 0.95 and Average Precision 0.92
